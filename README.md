# loris-comms
LORIS Comms Team Hub

## Getting Started
If you're new to the LORIS comms team, I'd like to welcome you!

GitHub is used by teams of people working together to share files and keep track of changes made to them over time. The plan here is for everyone to stay in sync and up to date with the latest presentation/document/code the team is working on.

If you wish, you may set up GitHub on your computer to automatically stay up to date with the files kept here. This is not necessary if you are not uploading/making changes frequently. If this is your case, using GitHub from your browser will do just fine.

Before proceeding with installing Git below, please make a GitHub account and contact me first so I can add you to our repository. loris@alexamellal.com is a good place to reach me.

### MINI How-to set up Git on your computer
#### Windows:
1. Download and install Git : https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Once installed, open CMD or powershell and simply write 'git' in the command line. If you see a bunch of nonsense, you've got it correctly installed! Otherwise, if something like 'command git not recognized', try restarting your computer/installing git again.

3. Once you're happy that you've installed it right, open file explorer and find somewhere you'd like our shared directory to be saved (ex: Documents -> LORIS stuff)

4. Inside the folder you've chosen, press Ctl + L to highlight your directory location, and write 'cmd' and hit enter. A terminal window should appear.

5. write 'git clone https://github.com/amellalalex/loris-comms.git ' and wait for it to complete

6. Voila, you're up to date. Next time you'd like to see what's going on, open a terminal in the same place and write 'git fetch' to get the latest files.

#### Mac/Linux:
1. Git is probably already installed on your distribution. Otherwise, download it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Once installed, open a terminal and navigate (using cd <directory>) to the directory you'd like our shared files to be saved.
  
3. Now write 'git clone https://github.com/amellalalex/loris-comms.git ' and wait for the shared directory to finish downloading.

4. Done! Next time you'd like to see what's going on, open a terminal in the same place and write 'git fetch' to get the latest files.

#### All distributions:
If you'd like to start contributing new files/changes to existing files, feel free to shoot me an email on how to do so (or look it up yourself but beware git can be unforgiving in deleting stuff if you're not sure what you're doing).

Once you know how to commit changes, shoot me an email loris@alexamellal.com and I'll add you as a contributor. **You must be added as a contributor before you can commit changes/add files**

## Team Workflow
Visit the projects tab on the main page to begin organizing work flow. See the template one for inspiration on how to make your own. Ideally, we would pay enough attention to these project workflows so that nobody wastes time working on something already done. It would also avoid the need to twiddle your thumbs when you've finished what you wanted to do.

## Using the 'Issues' Tab
If ever you find yourself working at something and you're looking for any general help from someone on the team, try and open an 'Issue'. Someone will come across it eventually, and if they feel as though their know-how may deem fit for your problem, they can immediately address it on the spot.

## What to do if there is a problem
When in doubt, send me an email loris@alexamellal.com
